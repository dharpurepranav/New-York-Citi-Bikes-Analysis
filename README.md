# New-York-Citi-Bikes-Analysis
 
Citi Bike is the largest bike-share program in the United States, with 20,000 bikes and over 1,300 pick-up stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Jersey City. As stated on their website, the service was designed for quick trips with convenience in mind, offering a fun and affordable way to get around town. Users can sign up for annual membership, or buy a short-term pass through the Citi Bike app. Once theyâ€™ve joined, they simply locate a nearby bike, ride around as they please, and return it to a nearby station once theyâ€™re done ðŸš´

Like most organizations, Citi Bike is constantly looking for ways to improve their business model and provide an even better experience for their customers. Through the Citi Bike app, they are able to gather loads of useful data which, when analyzed, reveals great insights into things like user demographics and behaviorâ€”for example, when and where people pick up and drop off their bikes and how long the average journey lasts. Such data is extremely valuable as it helps the good people at Citi Bike to understand how the service is being used, and to plan and make decisions accordingly. For example, at what rate is the customer base growing and how many more bikes should they install across the city to accommodate this growth? Where should they install the most bikes? Who should they tailor their marketing and advertising to? Essentially, data helps them to determine where and how their money and efforts can be invested for maximum impact.

So, throughout this process our mission is to analyze data collected by Citi Bike and help key stakeholders to make smart, data-driven decisions based on the insights we cover. Hereâ€™s what weâ€™ll seek to investigate:

What are the most popular pick-up locations across the city for NY Citi Bike rental?
How does the average trip duration vary across different age groups?
Which age group rents the most bikes?
How does bike rental vary across the two user groups (one-time users vs long-term subscribers) on different days of the week?
Does user age impact the average bike trip duration?
